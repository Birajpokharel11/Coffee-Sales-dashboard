# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard â˜•ðŸ“Š

This project is a **Power BI** dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of sales data for a coffee shop business. The dashboard enables business stakeholders to monitor performance across multiple metrics such as **total sales**, **orders**, **quantity sold**, and **product category trends**, while also offering insights into **time-based performance** (hourly, daily, weekly) and **location-specific analysis**.

## Key Features:
- **Sales Overview**: Track key metrics including total sales, total orders, and total quantity sold, with month-on-month comparisons.
- **Time-Based Analysis**: 
  - View sales trends by hour, day, and weekday vs. weekend performance.
  - Analyze sales peaks and troughs for better staffing and inventory management.
- **Location-Specific Insights**: See which store locations perform best and compare sales between them.
- **Product Category Performance**: Identify the top-performing product categories such as Coffee, Tea, Bakery, and more, with sales breakdowns for each.
- **Matrix Visualization**: Drill into hourly sales data by day of the week, helping identify the busiest times for promotions or inventory adjustments.
- **Month-on-Month Trend Analysis**: Compare sales and order data across different months using SQL queries for detailed analysis.

## SQL Queries for Data Analysis:
This repository also includes **SQL scripts** used for extracting insights from the coffee shop sales data, such as:
- Total sales, total orders, and quantity sold by month, day, and hour.
- **Month-on-month comparisons** to track growth and identify sales trends.
- Product category breakdowns and sales by store location.
- Weekday vs. weekend sales analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: For creating and visualizing interactive dashboards.
- **SQL Server**: For querying and analyzing the coffee sales dataset.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data transformation and preparation before loading into Power BI.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.pbix` Power BI file to view the dashboard.
3. The SQL scripts can be found in the `sql_queries` folder, which can be used for deeper data exploration or to modify the dataset for further insights.
